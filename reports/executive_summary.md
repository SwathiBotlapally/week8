## Executive Summary

This project analyzes three real-world business datasets: housing prices,
customer churn, and sales transactions. The analysis identifies pricing drivers,
predicts customer churn, and segments customers based on revenue behavior.

Key findings indicate that larger house sizes significantly increase prices,
higher monthly charges increase churn probability, and a small segment of
customers contributes the majority of sales revenue.

Actionable recommendations include targeted retention strategies, optimized
pricing models, and premium customer-focused marketing.
